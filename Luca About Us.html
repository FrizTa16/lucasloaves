        <h2>About LUCA'S LOAVES</h2>
        <b><p>Luca's Loaves is an artisan sourdough bread bakery located in Paramatta. Founded by Luca, who discovered his passion for breadmaking after being laid off from his job as a lifeguard, the bakery has grown from a small home-based business to a thriving local bakery.
            At Luca's Loaves, we believe in using only the finest organic ingredients, prepared with care and dedication. Our bread is hand-kneaded and shaped in-house, with no store-bought yeast, and baked to perfection in our solar-powered oven. We are committed to sustainability and use only filtered water in our baking process.
            Our bread is easy to digest and a great alternative to store-bought bread, which is often mixed and baked within 2 hours, resulting in a high gluten content. Our sourdough bread is prepared over 14-17 hours, allowing the gluten to break down, making it easier to digest.
        </b></p>

        <h2>Our Bread</h2>
        <b><p>All our bread is made from organic ingredients and is kneaded and shaped by hand.
            We make real bread from the best organic ingredients – by hand, with dedication, with heart, with love and with the best of care
